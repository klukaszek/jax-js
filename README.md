## Next on Eric's mind

- How many threads to create per workgroup, depends on hardware
- Should I define matmul in terms of `jit()`, or make it a separate primitive
  - Maybe the primitive can be some kind of einsum for dot/vecdot/matmul/diagonal/…
  - Actually yeah, before we build `jit()`, maybe a minimal einsum would be good enough
- Think about two-stage `cumsum()`
- Disposal by enforcing a `.ref` getter? This isn't included in console.log, but it's included in `{...spread}` syntax, hopefully not used often with arrays.
  ```js
  let f = (x) => x.ref.mul(x.ref).mul(x);
  let df = grad(f); // d/dx (x^3) = 3x^2
  expect(df(4)).toBeAllclose(48);
  expect(df(5)).toBeAllclose(75);
  ```
- Frontend transformations need to match backend type for pureArray() and zeros() calls

## Milestones

- [x] It works!
- [x] Demos: Browser REPL / editor
- [x] First custom kernel
- [x] Custom WebGPU backend, removing tfjs dependency
  - [x] Low-level operations
  - [x] Create `class Array {}` wrappers
  - [x] Reduction operations
- [ ] Kernel tuning (see `tuner.ts`)
  - [x] "Upcast" optimizations (compute a tile per thread, e.g., matmul)
  - [ ] "Unroll" optimizations (multiple loop iters per thread, e.g., matmul)
  - [ ] "Group" optimizations (multiple threads per value, e.g., matvec)
  - [ ] Blocks respect local dimensions
- [ ] We figure out the `dispose()` / refcount / linear types stuff
- [ ] Demos: Navier-Stokes, neural networks, statistics
- [ ] Wasm backend (needs malloc)
  - [ ] SIMD support for Wasm backend
- [ ] Device switching with `.to()` between webgpu/cpu/wasm
- [ ] `jit()` support via Jaxprs and kernel fusion
- [ ] Other dtypes like int32 and bool
- [ ] numpy/jax API compatibility table
- [ ] Import tfjs models
